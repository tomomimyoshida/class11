```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## GitHub Documents

```{r}
# Download some example PDB files
ids <- c("1TND_B","1AGR_A","1TAG_A","1GG2_A","1KJY_A","4G5Q_A")
files <- get.pdb(ids, split = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Extract and align the chains we are interested in
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE)
# Print to screen a summary of the 'pdbs' object
pdbs
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
